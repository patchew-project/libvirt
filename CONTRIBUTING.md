Contributing to libvirt
=======================

Full, up to date information on how to contribute to libvirt can be

[https://libvirt.org/hacking.html](https://libvirt.org/hacking.html)

To build the same document locally, from the top level directory of
your git clone run:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ ../autogen.sh
$ make
```

You'll find the freshly-built document in `docs/hacking.html`.
