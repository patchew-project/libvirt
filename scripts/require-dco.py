This project requires all contributors to assert that their contributions
are provided in compliance with the terms of the Developer's Certificate
of Origin 1.1 (DCO):

  https://developercertificate.org/

To indicate acceptance of the DCO every commit must have a tag

  Signed-off-by: REAL NAME <EMAIL>

This can be achieved by passing the "-s" flag to the "git commit" command.

To bulk update all commits on current branch "git rebase" can be used:

  git rebase -i master -x 'git commit --amend --no-edit -s'

""")
