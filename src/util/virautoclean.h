/**
 * DEPRECATION WARNING
 *
 * The macros in this file should not be used in newly written code.
 * Use the equivalent GLib macros instead.
 *
 * For existing code, use of the libvirt and GLib macros must NEVER
 * be mixed within a single method.
 *
 * The use of the libvirt VIR_FREE macros should also not be mixed
 * with GLib auto-free macros and vica-verca.
 *
 * Existing code should be converted to the new GLib macros and
 * g_free APIs as needed.
