 * Define __GNUC_PREREQ to a sane default if it isn't yet defined.
 * This is done here so that it's included as early as possible; gnulib relies
 * on this to be defined in features.h, which should be included from ctype.h.
 * This doesn't happen on many non-glibc systems.
 * When __GNUC_PREREQ is not defined, gnulib defines it to 0, which breaks things.
