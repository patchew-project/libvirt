    <h2><a id="BackupAttributes">Backup XML</a></h2>

    <p>
      Creating a backup, whether full or incremental, is done
      via <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code>, which takes an XML
      description of the actions to perform, as well as an optional
      second XML document <a href="formatcheckpoint.html">describing a
      checkpoint</a> to create at the same point in time. See
      also <a href="domainstatecapture.html">a comparison</a> between
      the various state capture APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two general modes for backups: a push mode (where the
      hypervisor writes out the data to the destination file, which
      may be local or remote), and a pull mode (where the hypervisor
      creates an NBD server that a third-party client can then read as
      needed, and which requires the use of temporary storage,
      typically local, until the backup is complete).
    </p>
    <p>
      The instructions for beginning a backup job are provided as
      attributes and elements of the
      top-level <code>domainbackup</code> element. This element
      includes an optional attribute <code>mode</code> which can be
      either "push" or "pull" (default
      push). <code>virDomainBackupGetXMLDesc()</code> can be used to
      see the actual values selected for elements omitted during
      creation (for example, learning which port the NBD server is
      using in the pull model or what file names libvirt generated
      when none were supplied). The following child elements are
      supported:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>id</code></dt>
      <dd>Ignored on input, this element is the job id of the backup
        operation returned on success
        from <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code>, and is used for
        selecting which backup operation to target
        during <code>virDomainBackupGetXMLDesc()</code>
        and <code>virDomainBackupEnd()</code>. (Note that until
        additional APIs are added for supporting parallel jobs, it is
        also possible to ignore this element and use the job
        id <code>0</code> to refer to the one and only current backup
        job.)</dd>
      <dt><code>incremental</code></dt>
      <dd>An optional element giving the name of an existing
        checkpoint of the domain, which will be used to make this
        backup an incremental one. In the push model, only changes
        since the named checkpoint are written to the destination. In
        the pull model, the NBD server uses the
        NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT extension to advertise to the client
        which portions of the export contain changes since the named
        checkpoint. If omitted, a full backup is performed.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>server</code></dt>
      <dd>Present only for a pull mode backup. Contains the same
        attributes as
        the <a href="formatdomain.html#elementsDisks"><code>protocol</code>
        element of a disk</a> attached via NBD in the domain (such as
        transport, socket, name, port, or tls), necessary to set up an
        NBD server that exposes the content of each disk at the time
        the backup is started.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>disks</code></dt>
      <dd>An optional listing of instructions for disks participating
        in the backup (if omitted, all disks participate and libvirt
        attempts to generate filenames by appending the current
        timestamp as a suffix). If the entire element was omitted on
        input, then all disks participate in the backup, otherwise,
        only the disks explicitly listed which do not also
        use <code>backup='no'</code> will participate. On output, this
        is the state of each of the domain's disk in relation to the
        backup operation.
        <dl>
          <dt><code>disk</code></dt>
          <dd>This sub-element describes the backup properties of a
            specific disk, with the following attributes and child
            elements:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>name</code></dt>
              <dd>A mandatory attribute which must match either
                the <code>&lt;target dev='name'/&gt;</code> or an
                unambiguous <code>&lt;source file='name'/&gt;</code>
                of one of
                the <a href="formatdomain.html#elementsDisks">disk
                devices</a> specified for the domain at the time of
                the checkpoint.</dd>
              <dt><code>backup</code></dt>
              <dd>An optional attribute to describe the state of the
                backup for the given disk. On input, the
                value <code>no</code> skips a backup of the disk, and
                any other value is ignored; on output, other values
                such as <code>begin</code>, <code>inprogress</code>,
                or <code>ready</code> track the backup progress that
                libvirt has observed for that disk.</dd>
              <dt><code>type</code></dt>
              <dd>An optional attribute to describe the type of the
                disk, except when <code>backup='no'</code> is
                used. Valid values include <code>file</code>
                or <code>block</code> for both push and pull model
                backups; in the future, <code>network</code> may be
                added for push model backups. Similar to a disk
                declaration for a domain, the choice of type controls
                what additional sub-elements are needed to describe
                the destination (such as <code>protocol</code> for a
                network destination).</dd>
              <dt><code>target</code></dt>
              <dd>Valid only for push mode backups, this is the
                primary sub-element that describes the file name of
                the backup destination, similar to
                the <code>source</code> sub-element of a domain
                disk. An optional sub-element <code>driver</code> can
                also be used, with an attribute <code>type</code> to
                specify a destination format different from
                qcow2. Additionally, if a push backup is not
                incremental, <code>target</code> may contain an
                optional attribute <code>shallow="on"</code> so that
                the destination file copies only the top-most source
                file in a backing chain, rather than collapsing the
                entire chain into the copy.</dd>
              <dt><code>scratch</code></dt>
              <dd>Valid only for pull mode backups, this is the
                primary sub-element that describes the file name of
                the local scratch file to be used in facilitating the
                backup, and is similar to the <code>source</code>
                sub-element of a domain disk.</dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2><a id="example">Examples</a></h2>

    <p>Use <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code> to perform a full
      backup using push mode. The example lets libvirt pick the
      destination and format for 'vda', fully specifies that we want a
      raw backup of 'vdb', and omits 'vdc' from the operation.
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;domainbackup&gt;
  &lt;disks/&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vda'/&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vdb' type='file'&gt;
      &lt;target file='/path/to/vdb.backup'/&gt;
      &lt;driver type='raw'/&gt;
    &lt;/disk&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vdc' backup='no'/&gt;
  &lt;/disks/&gt;
&lt;/domainbackup&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>If the previous full backup also passed a parameter describing
      <a href="formatcheckpoint.html">checkpoint XML</a> that resulted
      in a checkpoint named <code>1525889631</code>, we can make
      another call to <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code> to perform
      an incremental backup of just the data changed since that
      checkpoint, this time using the following XML to start a pull
      model export of the 'vda' and 'vdb' disks, where a third-party
      NBD client connecting to '/path/to/server' completes the backup
      (omitting 'vdc' from the explicit list has the same effect as
      the backup='no' from the previous example):
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;domainbackup mode="pull"&gt;
  &lt;incremental&gt;1525889631&lt;/incremental&gt;
  &lt;server transport="unix" socket="/path/to/server"/&gt;
  &lt;disks/&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vda' type='file'&gt;
      &lt;scratch file='/path/to/file1.scratch'/&gt;
    &lt;/disk&gt;
  &lt;/disks/&gt;
&lt;/domainbackup&gt;
    </pre>
