    <h1>Supported host platforms</h1>

    <ul id="toc"></ul>

    <h2>Build targets</h2>

    <p>
      Libvirt drivers aim to support building and executing on multiple
      host OS platforms. This document outlines which platforms are the
      major build targets. These platforms are used as the basis for deciding
      upon the minimum required versions of 3rd party software libvirt depends
      on. If a platform is no listed here, it does not imply that libvirt
      won't work. If an unlisted platform has comparable software versions
      to a listed platform, there is every expectation that it will work.
      Bug reports are welcome for problems encountered on unlisted platforms
      unless they are clearly older vintage that what is described here.
    </p>

    <h3>Linux OS</h3>

    <p>
      For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases (Fedora,
      Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc), the project will aim to support all versions
      that are not end of life by their respective vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
      For distributions with long-lifetime releases (RHEL, Ubuntu LTS,
      SLES, etc), the project will aim to support the most recent major
      version at all times. Support for the previous major version will
      be dropped 2 years after the new major version is released.
    </p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>

    <p>
      The project supports building with current versions of the MinGW
      toolchain, hosted on Linux.
    </p>

    <h3>OS-X</h3>

    <p>
      The project supports building with the current version of OS-X,
      with the current homebrew package set available.
    </p>

    <h3>FreeBSD</h3>

    <p>
      The project will aim to support the most recent major version
      at all times. Support for the previous major version will
      be dropped 2 years after the new major version is released.
    </p>

    <h2>Virtualization platforms</h2>

    <p>
      For hypervisor drivers which execute locally (QEMU, LXC, VZ,
      libxl, etc), the set of supported operating system platforms
      listed above will inform choices as to the minimum required
      versions of 3rd party libraries and hypervisor management APIs.
      If a hypervisor is not commonly shipped directly by any distro
      listed above, (VMWare ESX, HyperV, VZ), the project aims to
      support versions upto 5 years, or until the vendor discontinues
      support, whichever comes first.
